=== Table {src:"quantum-software.toml", id:"tab:software", title:"Open-source quantum software libraries"}
~~~
List of open-source quantum software libraries. These packages are designed using common computing languages such as python, C++ or Julia. Some of them can be used in real quantum hardware, either because the developers are also building these devices or because the package include other quantum libraries. Some of them can translate their code to other quantum libraries or simulators. 

*Hardware not publicly available yet. **Not on own hardware but can be run in a hardware backend.

=== Table {src:"external-lib.toml", title:"External open-source libraries"}
~~~
External open-source libraries useful for the NISQ era. These libraries have applications in chemistry, machine learning, circuit compilation and quantum control. Some of them are integrated in the quantum software libraries listed in [#tab:software].
